       <p>We are not limited in what we can create, but by what we can imagine.</p>
       <p> My name is Maria O'Sullivan, and I an digtital artist, and software engineering student.</p>
        
        <p>I strive to live life creatively and honestly. Life, art, and programing are all collaborative mediums,
        and often times differnt perspectives will make or break a project. 
        I offer a fresh minset and explorative thought processes on any project I undertake,
        all while delivering a high quality product in a timely manner.</p>
        
        <p>Email me at mosullivan@sea.yearup.org if creativity, kindess, 
        and quality results are values you want on your team. </p>

        <h2>Always Growing</h2>
        <p> I am currently persuing an education in software development through Year Up's certificate program. I have a passion for creativity, innovation, and technology that I strive to bring into ever aspect of my life. 
          At age 19, I cofounded a software development company named PolyWare Studios where I worked as the creative executive. Back then I didnt know much about the software development lifecycle,
          but through my time at Year Up I've gained a lot of insight and knowledge. The connections I've made are invaulable, and am eager to emerge into the inustry. Curently, I own and operate my own digital art business, AltoHearts Creations. 
          Which I opperate in my free time outside of work and school. Iâ€™m dedicated to becoming a software engineer. With strong leadership skills, and an entrepreneurial spirit, I would love to connect with others inside the tech industry</p>
